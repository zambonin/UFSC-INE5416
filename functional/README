The first assignment was programmed as a module that calculates the area and
volume of some shapes (spheroids, cylinders, cones and frustums). One may
use it through the interpreter, creating objects with their measurements:

    $ ghci ine5416_t1.hs
    ...
    *Shapes> volume (Cylinder 3 4)
    50.265484

Original assignment: 462c5b1ce1a391f7da643b95e997f4dffa897c01

The second assignment is a module that calculates some summations, and
approximations through Taylor series. Again, it may be used through the
interpreter:

    $ ghci ine5416_t2.hs
    ...
    *Summation> almostEuler 1000
    2.7182818284590455

Original assignment: bd6c2c84494130c45386ca14ccb4272d1bfb646c

The third assignment separates a BMP file with a simple header and no alpha
channel into arrays of red, blue and green floating point intensity values,
writing these to files.

    $ runhaskell ine5416_t3 input.bmp

Original assignment: 198c05d8620810e8736f5562ccbf4a1db860019e
